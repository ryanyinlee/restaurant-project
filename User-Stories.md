# User Stories

## As a user I want to be able to reference the website to see location and hours easily.
Test: Ensure that the webpage/photos load, and the website is navigatable

## As a out-of-town visitor I want to be able to reference the website to see how busy the restaurant is in real-time by a heatmap bar chart because I am not a local.
Test: Make sure that the heatmap is not showing a completely unrealistic bar chart with maximum interest @ midnight.

## As a pennypincher I want a easy and basic website to browse to give me information on how much the food costs
Test: Make sure that the food populates a reasonable price, along with an appropriate picture.
## As a repeat customer I want to be able to re-order my last 


## As a manager I want to be able to know the busy times so I know when to employ more staff.
