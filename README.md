# restaurant-project

Team Members: Jordan Watts (JWatts), Jacob Choi (JChoi), Mike Metcalf (MMetcalf), Brian Thornburg (BThornburg), Ryan Lee (RLee)

This project is a demonstration of a website for a restaurant that will have the following pages:

Main Page: Greeting and photos of food. Link together the other pages.

Menu Page: A page for a modifiable menu that shows the food items for sale, prices, and photos. This will have shopping cart support for online ordering.

Locations Page: A place for a chain to show different locations, or for a single restaurant to show directions and hours.

Management Page: A page where the menu can be managed using DOM, entry boxes, as well as statistics on sales.
