### Cooperation Plan

*What are the key strengths of each person on the team?*

- JWatts: Debugging, "overview", planning, weak on front end.
- JChoi: Well rounded.
- BThornburg: Graphic design and styling decisions, I also have experience working in the restaurant industry.
- RLee: A bit of CSS, writing, research, and manual testing.
- MMetcalf: Well rounded, not really great or horrible at any one task.

*How can you best utilize these strengths in the execution of your project?*

- JWatts: I want to make sure that I actually provide the most usefulness I can to the group, as my skills are really varied.
- JChoi: I can focus on my list of duties and help collaborate on our teammates work and work together to complete this project.
- BThornburg: I would like to become stronger on css, I feel I've spent most of my time on javascript and site functionality but am not adverse to working on those.
- RLee: I can help add some aesthetic touches to the page, as well as test the program to find any odd bugs. Can have text other than lorum ipsum.
- MMetcalf: I am happy to work on anything that needs to be done

*In which professional competencies do you each want to develop greater strength?*

- JWatts: CSS and front-end beautification.
- JChoi: CSS and technical abilities.
- BThornburg: CSS but also wouldn't mind working through javascript to solidify my understanding
- RLee: Want to develop more technical ability and team working skills on a shared technical project.
- MMetcalf: I'd like to improve my technical ability


*Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand all aspects of the project, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day work?*

Regular communication and through adapation of the Agile method.

Have a daily meeting each morning to talk and double check others. (from Jordan)
- What did you do yesterday?
- What problems did you face yesterday?
- What are you doing today?
- Finishing remarks.


### Conflict Plan

*What will be your group’s process to resolve conflict, when it arises?*

If we can't agree then we will settle it in the Thunder Dome if it can be arranged in a timely manner. I that doesn't work, we will vote cause we have an odd number.

*What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other members contribute?*

We would have to speak with them as a group. If it gets bad we would take away their git push access and have their commits approved by group.

*How will you approach each other and the challenges of the project knowing that it is impossible for all members to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?*

Get team members up to speed on your updated code so that they may help troubleshoot.

*How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing?*

I think it's best to take them aside privately and ask if they need any assistance.
We will have a frank conversation with them and if that doesn't fix it then we will bring it to JB.

*How and when will you escalate the conflict if your resolution attempts are unsuccessful?*

Like said before, if we can't agree then we will settle it in the Thunder Dome if it can be arranged in a timely manner. I that doesn't work, we will vote cause we have an odd number. If that doesn't work, then we go to JB.

*What platforms will you use to communicate (ie. Slack, phone …)?*

We will be using Slack as we have it on mobile apps and the Remo labspace for work time.

*How often will you take breaks?*

The group consensus was that we take them as often as needed but to not overdo it. 12-1 Lunch and 6-7-ish for dinner if doing long days.

*How will you ensure that you are creating a safe environment where everyone feels comfortable speaking up?*

Speak up when you have an thought, open consideration of all ideas.

Slack/slack mobile.
